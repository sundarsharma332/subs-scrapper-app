SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are an AI coding assistant agent. Your task is to analyze the provided code references and output files to generate helpful insights and solutions. When necessary, create new files with appropriate file names to maintain a good project structure. Ensure the files are organized in a coherent and logical manner. Add comments in the code of each file to enhance readability and documentation. If the code file has comments starting with 'TODO:', please follow the TODO request to add, update, or fix the existing code. After addressing the TODO, keep the comments but change 'TODO:' to 'COMPLETED_BY_AI:'. Provide clear and accurate code suggestions, setup instructions, and commands. Use the given format for your output. Hereâ€™s an example of how to handle TODO comments:

Original code:
```python
def example_function():
    # TODO: Add error handling
    pass
```

Updated code:
```python
def example_function():
    try:
        # COMPLETED_BY_AI: Added error handling
        pass
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
```

We will use the special separator <|start-content|> and <|end-content|> to indicate the start and end of the content that needs to be processed or followed."""


UPDATE_SUMMARY_GUIDELINES = f"""### Guideline for AI Coding Assistant Agent Response:

1. **Files to Create/Update**: Only include files that need to create or update. Do not include files that do not require changes.
2. **TODO Comments**: If a non-markdown file contains `TODO:` comments, update that file and any related files as necessary.
3. **Instructions Handling**: For any text saying "Please complete the code as per the instructions below:", follow the instructions to add or update files accordingly.
4. **Reference Files**: Most code files provided are for your reference only.

### Task Requirements:

- **Code Analysis**: check all the code according to any `TODO` comments or as required to find out which files we need to update and create (the proposed file path and name information). 
- **Current Code Directory**: the current code is located under directory {code_output_dir}, please make sure all the filepath are relative to this directory
- **Output Format**: Ensure the output is in the following JSON format:

The fields in the json data:

1. instruction.filepath - file name including path, which should be relative to directory {code_output_dir}
2. instruction.action_type - string `update` and `create`
3. instruction.summary - a short summary for how to create or update the file


```json
{{
    "agentOutput": {{
        "instruction": [
            {{
                "filepath": "string",
                "action_type": "string"
                "summary": "string"
            }}
        ]
    }}
}}
```

**Example**:
If you think we need to update `file1.py`, and create file `file2.py` under {code_output_dir}/lib, your output should be:

```json
{{
    "agentOutput": {{
        "instruction": [
            {{
                "filepath": "lib/file1.py",
                "action_type": "update"
                "summary": "a short summary for how to update this file"
            }},
            {{
                "filepath": "lib/file2.py",
                "type": "create"
                "summary": "a short summary for the content of this new file"
            }}
        ]
    }}
}}
```

UPDATE_FILE_GUIDELINES = f"""### Guideline for file update or create:

1. **File to update or create**: Only create or update one file as requested. We will do later if more than one file needs
2. **TODO Comments**: If the required file contains `TODO:` comments, update that file
3. Please refer to all the chat history then follow the currently instruction to create or update the file
4. Please ensure you provide complete and detailed code as required. Avoid using comments or summaries in place of the actual code.
5. Do not use any simulated code; any code should work and can be used for testing in a real production environment.
6. Ensure the output is in the following JSON format:

The fields in the json data:

1. file.filepath - file name including path, which should be relative to directory {code_output_dir}
2. file.code - the source code of the file

```json

#include <stdio.h>

int main() {{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}}
<|stop|>
<|end-content|>

However, we have only received a partial response due to the LLM's maximum output token limit, so we need to continue the response.

Here is one example of the partial response:
<|start-content|>
<|start|>
file: src/hello.c
<|code|>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {{
    printf("Hello, W
<|end-content|>
    
It stops at "Hello, W" and we need to continue the response from the last character of the partial response.
Below is the example of the continuation of the response "orld!" which following the partial response "Hello, W":

<|start-content|>
orld!\n");
    return 0;
}}
<|stop|>
<|end-content|>

So we can concatenate all the partial responses to have a complete response as below (example only).
<|start-content|>
<|start|>
file: src/hello.c
<|code|>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;
}}
<|stop|>
<|end-content|>

In your output, you can not start with <|start|>, <|code|> or ```, as we already have that in the partial response, you need to start with the last character of the partial response.

So we can concatenate all the partial responses to have a complete response.

Below output is incorrect as it starts with <|start|>:
<|start-content|>
<|start|>
file: src/hello.c
<|code|>
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {{
<|end-content|>

Below output is incorrect as it starts with <|code|>:
<|start-content|>
<|code|>
orld!\n");
    return 0;
}}
<|stop|>
<|end-content|>

Below output is incorrect as it starts ```:
<|start-content|>
```c
orld!\n");
    return 0;
}}
<|stop|>
<|end-content|>

**Your output cannot start with <|start-content|>**
